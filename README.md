# US GDP prediction
This repository is dedicated to the group project for the exam __Time Series and Forecasting__.

The project's authors are:
- [__Guglielmo Berzano__](https://github.com/guber25)
- [__Nicol√≤ Pignatelli__](https://github.com/NicoPigna)

The objective of the project was to create several time series models to forecast the progress of US GDP and select the one minimizing the _root mean square error_ __RMSE__. This was performed also by considering Inflation, Spread - the difference between long and short-term bonds - and factors, summarised by the _principal component analysis_ __PCA__.
