# US GDP prediction ðŸ’µ
This repository is dedicated to the group project for the exam __Time Series and Forecasting__ ðŸ”®

Project's authors are:
- [__Guglielmo Berzano__](https://github.com/guber25)
- [__NicolÃ² Pignatelli__](https://github.com/NicoPigna)

The objective of the project was to create several time series models to forecast the progress of US GDP and select the one minimizing the _root mean square error_ __RMSE__. This was performed also by considering Inflation, Spread - the difference between long and short-term bonds - and factors, summarised by the _principal component analysis_ __PCA__.

Data can be retrieved by accessing to their dedicated folder but, in order to see the complete xlsx file, you should download them. Same goes with the code: there is a specific folder from which you can perform the download to inspect code on your local machine using Matlab. 

We are open to receive any feedback from you! ðŸš€

Guglielmo, NicolÃ²
